# Class project 2 | Road Segmentation

This is our submission for the second project of "CS-433: Machine Learning" where we designed an Image segmentation model using Deep Learning.


## Problem description

In this project, we were provided a set of satellite images acquired from Google Maps, along with the groundtruth images associated with these images. In the latter, each pixel is given one of two colors: white if the pixel in the corresponding aerial image happens to be on a road, and black otherwise. Below we show an example of an image and its groundtruth right next to it.

Our task was to create a model that could generate grountruths for 50 new aerial images.
